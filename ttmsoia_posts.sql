There was a Real ID Act of 2005 that was met with resistance from the states, and I\'m not sure where that stands, but then there is this Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative thing that I can\'t figure out. Is it a law? Is it in effect?  Regardless, it includes an \"Enhanced Driver\'s License\" that features an RFID chip. \r\n\r\nThis is from the Department of Homeland Security\'s website:\r\n\"State-issued enhanced drivers licenses (EDLs) provide proof of  identity and U.S. citizenship, are issued in a secure process, and include technology that makes travel easier. They provide travelers with a low-cost, convenient alternative for entering the United States from Canada, Mexico or the Caribbean through a land or sea port of entry, in addition to serving as a permit to drive.\r\n\r\nThe Department has been working with states to enhance their drivers licenses and identification documents to comply with travel rules under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI), effective June 1, 2009. The states of Michigan, New York, Vermont and Washington are issuing these enhanced drivers licenses.\"\r\n\r\nSo whatever it is, it apparently was effective June 1st, 2009. \r\n\r\nFrom the Department of Homeland Security\'s website:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dhs.gov/xtrvlsec/crossingborders/gc_1197575704846.shtm\">Enhanced Drivers Licenses: What Are They?</a>\r\n\r\nThis is from WorldNetDaily, an admittedly conservative website I\'m not that familiar with.

This fact can be explained only by the principles of the American constitutions. In France the constitution is, or at least is supposed to be, immutable; and the received theory is that no power has the right of changing any part of it.1 In England the constitution may change continually,2 or rather it does not in reality exist; the Parliament is at once a legislative and a constituent assembly. The political theories of America are more simple and more rational. An American constitution is not supposed to be immutable, as in France; nor is it susceptible of modification by the ordinary powers of society, as in England. It constitutes a detached whole, which, as it represents the will of the whole people, is no less binding on the legislator than on the private citizen, but which may be altered by the will of the people in predetermined cases, according to established rules. In America the Constitution may therefore vary; but as long as it exists, it is the origin of all authority, and the sole vehicle of the predominating force.', 'Toqueville on the Judiciary', 'From Book I, Chapter VI\r\n\r\nThe Americans have retained these three distinguishing characteristics of the judicial power: an American judge can pronounce a decision only when litigation has arisen, he is conversant only with special cases, and he cannot act until the cause has been duly brought before the court.

A nation that is determined to remain free is therefore right in demanding, at any price, the exercise of this independence. But the unlimited liberty of political association cannot be entirely assimilated to the liberty of the press. The one is at the same time less necessary and more dangerous than the other. A nation may confine it within certain limits without forfeiting any part of its self-directing power; and it may sometimes be obliged to do so in order to maintain its own authority.\r\n\r\nIn America the liberty of association for political purposes is unlimited. An example will show in the clearest light to what an extent this privilege is tolerated.\r\n\r\nThe question of a tariff or free trade has much agitated the minds of Americans. The tariff was not only a subject of debate as a matter of opinion, but it affected some great material interests of the states. The North attributed a portion of its prosperity, and the South nearly all its sufferings, to this system. For a long time the tariff was the sole source of the political animosities that agitated the Union.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, when the dispute was raging with the greatest violence, a private citizen of Massachusetts proposed, by means of the newspapers, to all the enemies of the tariff to send delegates to Philadelphia in order to consult together upon the best means of restoring freedom of trade. This proposal circulated in a few days, by the power of the press, from Maine to New Orleans. The opponents of the tariff adopted it with enthusiasm; meetings were held in all quarters, and delegates were appointed. The majority of these delegates were well known, and some of them had earned a considerable degree of celebrity. South Carolina alone, which afterwards took up arms in the same cause, sent sixty-three delegates. On the 1st of October 1831 this assembly, which, according to the American custom, had taken the name of a Convention, met at Philadelphia; it consisted of more than two hundred members. Its debates were public, and they at once assumed a legislative character; the extent of the powers of Congress, the theories of free trade, and the different provisions of the tariff were discussed. At the end of ten days the Convention broke up, having drawn up an address to the American people in which it declared (1 ) that Congress had not the right of making a tariff, and that the existing tariff was unconstitutional; (2) that the prohibition of free trade was prejudicial to the interests of any nation, and to those of the American people especially.\r\n\r\nIt must be acknowledged that the unrestrained liberty of political association has not hitherto produced in the United States the fatal results that might perhaps be expected from it elsewhere. The right of association was imported from England, and it has always existed in America; the exercise of this privilege is now incorporated with the manners and customs of the people. At the present time the liberty of association has become a necessary guarantee against the tyranny of the majority. In the United States, as soon as a party has become dominant, all public authority passes into its hands; its private supporters occupy all the offices and have all the force of the administration at their disposal. As the most distinguished members of the opposite party cannot surmount the barrier that excludes them from power, they must establish themselves outside of it and oppose the whole moral authority of the minority to the physical power that domineers over it. Thus a dangerous expedient is used to obviate a still more formidable danger.\r\n\r\nThe omnipotence of the majority appears to me to be so full of peril to the American republics that the dangerous means used to bridle it seem to be more advantageous than prejudicial. And here I will express an opinion that may remind the reader of what I said when speaking of the freedom of townships. There are no countries in which associations are more needed to prevent the despotism of faction or the arbitrary power of a prince than those which are democratically constituted. In aristocratic nations the body of the nobles and the wealthy are in themselves natural associations which check the abuses of power. In countries where such associations do not exist, if private individuals cannot create an artificial and temporary substitute for them I can see no permanent protection against the most galling tyranny; and a great people may be oppressed with impunity by a small faction or by a single individual.', 'Toqueville on Free Press and Freedom of Association', '\"Freedom of Association\": http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association\r\n\r\nFrom Book 1, Chapter 12, \"Political Associations in the United States\"\r\n\r\nThe more I consider the independence of the press in its principal consequences, the more am I convinced that in the modern world it is the chief \r', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'ToquevilleonFreePressandFreedomofAssociation', '', '', '2010-02-22 18:30:14', '2010-02-22 18:30:14', '', 0, 'http://andyhill.us/ttmsoia/?p=32', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Walker held government posts from the Reagan to the Bush 43 administrations and was comptroller general of the United States and CEO of the Government Accountability Office from 1998-2008, so it\'s reasonable to think he may know what he\'s talking about.\r\n\r\nWalker claims to be an independent and the book is impressively non-partisan. He slams Bush43\'s excessive spending, but is worried about what he\'s seen from Obama as of the writing. He credits Clinton\'s fiscal discipline, but also credits Ross Perot\'s highlighting our nation\'s financial peril for giving Clinton little choice. Some of his solutions seem a little left of center to me, but he does seem grounded in the constitution and fiscal responsibility.\r\n\r\n- Fiscal Crisis 101:  describes our current financial situation, which is rather harrowing. He approximates our debt at $1.42 trillion (9.9% of our economy) and then lays out our \"fiscal exposure\" (sum of benefits, programs, debt, etc. that we will eventually owe): $56.4 trillion. \r\n- America 2030: Why We Must Act -- Now: he describes how our national standing is at risk if we continue to borrow at current rates.\r\n- Principles From Our History and Common Sense: Looks back at history and kind of segways into a pep talk. Interesting stuff.\r\n- Obama\'s Challenge: praises him for what he\'s done right, forgives him in light of the crisis, but overall thinks he needs to get a lot more serious about spending\r\n- Save Social Security First: he thinks changes would include raising the benefit age and tie it to life expectancy, increasing revenues, mandatory savings accounts,  and incentivizing later retirement.\r\n- Curing Health Care: he does think that universal heath care for \"basic and essential\" health care to be financially feasible, which surprised me. Lays out 4 pillars: Fiscal Discipline (cap on spending),  Better standards of practice (using clinical evidence to make informed decisions), Personal responsibility, and the \"basic and essential\" universal care I mentioned.\r\n- Collect More Revenue -- More Fairly: Reviews the inequities and inefficiencies of the tax system. He proposes a consumer tax of the VAT variety on top of reform of the income tax system. I like the idea of taxing consumption, rather than production; and would lean toward the fair or flat tax strategies, which he acknowledges, but doesn\'t really address. I tend to think a VAT would kill the private sector.\r\n- Addressing America\'s International Deficits: We\'re pretty screwed. That said, he proposes citizens saving money and updating global trading rules to address the global economy in addition to general fiscal discipline.\r\n- Getting Control of the Pentagon: I\'m glad he addressed this. Just because we have the most awesome military ever doesn\'t mean that it couldn\'t be fiscally leaner without sacrificing its awesomeness. Especially when politics get involved. He gives credit to an existing commission and officer without teeth and basically calls for a stronger commission and something resembling a CEO for military spending.\r\n- Transforming Government: Mostly a case study of his time in charge of the GAO. He cut staff and bureaucracy, introduced performance metrics and objective-setting, and changed the name of the department from \"General Accounting Office\" to \"Government Accountability Office\" (which I think is pretty cool).\r\n- Fixing Our Dysfunctional Democracy: Pretty much calls for a constitutional convention (or some kind of amendments) to address term limits, debt limits, and a number of other things.\r\n\r\nOverall, while I don\'t agree with all his solutions, he weaves a lot of history and words of the founders into the economic base of his analysis. More importantly, I think he raises some of the issues that we will need to grapple with, regardless of ideology.

They weren\'t particularly vocal about it or anything. I remember their disappointment when Carter was elected, but I wouldn\'t say I was raised in a particularly political household. I didn\'t really think about politics much growing up that I can remember. Meta-politically, I was unnerved by industrial development and war and poverty, etc., but didn\'t really correlate solutions with political parties or ideologies. I do remember watching portions of the Iran Contra hearings and being disillusioned, but still am pretty sure I voted for Bush in \'88 (my first election!). \r\n\r\nToward the end of my high school career,  I started getting into the hippie culture, and got further into it throughout the first two of my college years. I was convinced the hippies would complete what they had started in the 60s, that it was a matter of time before my parents and everyone else \"got\" the hippie thing. I read <u>Be Here Now</u> while on acid and thought I was enlightened. \r\n\r\nThe Gulf War broke out in \'90 and I was devastated and not alone. A guy called Phoenix set up a tent in Dunn Meadow and soon a round the clock vigil/protest was born. School (which my parents were paying for) took a back seat to the cause. Regardless of any recklessness with my parents\' investment, I\'m still glad I stood up for what I believed in. We sang \"Give Peace a Chance\" so much I wanted to puke, but at the same time, that idea was so core to my perspective. A group of conservatives came down one night*, and we were terrified. I don\'t remember much else, as I was stoned most of the time. After heated exchanges, I think we honestly held hands and sang \"Give Peace a Chance\" until they went away. I think there may have actually been some act of aggression on their part, but it\'s all fuzzy.\r\n\r\nSocialism and anti-capitalist rhetoric was not the order of the day, really. The war was considered imperialistic and profit-driven, but I don\'t remember a lot of a further indictment of capitalism itself. There was a quirky song called, \"You Ain\'t Been Doing Nothing If You Ain\'t Been Called a Red\", but I still consider that a parody of McCarthyism, rather than an ideological call to arms. There were two individuals who were considered \"The Socialists\". I had no opinion of socialism at the time, but intuitively considered them the dark side of the peace movement. It was a professor and a student (his protogee?) and they, in retrospect, were truly at the vanguard wearing keffiyehs in 1990. \r\n\r\nSomehow the camp out on campus evolved into a storefront on 3rd street called the Peace and Justice Center. It was an interesting experiment in idealism meeting reality and, looking back, a preview of what happens when a group of disparate radicals with pet causes try to find a common front. I was quite involved and bewildered that more weren\'t getting in on the ground floor of the (non-violent) revolution.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this, I started to lose faith in hippie-dom. I was always pretty musically open-minded and a friend of mine had lent me N.W.A.\'s Straight Out of Compton after he heard I liked Public Enemy. I was drawn by the rawness of it and began to feel the hippie movement was not radical enough. At the same time,  I started hanging out with anarchists and reading Goldman, Bakunin, Anarchy magazine, etc. Between these, the peace movement started to seem too benign. A favorite poster I wheat pasted at the time compared holding hands for peace to lambs being led to the slaughter. \r\n\r\nI dropped out of college after my junior year. I drifted away from anarchist theory, but didn\'t cling to another. I listened to Too $hort, Naughty By Nature, Ice T, Geto Boys. I listened to the Clash, Dead Kennedys, and the Misfits. I listened to Nirvana and Alice in Chains (Sound Garden, not so much). I listened to Slayer, Biohazard, and Sick of It All. I listened to Brown Betty and Tangleweed. I worked in restaurant kitchens and, to paraphrase The Clash, hit the town and drank my wages. Any specific policy critiques were subsumed by a general disapproval of \"The System\". I\'m currently not even sure what that means, but it certainly didn\'t include any solutions. \r\n\r\nAs time went on, I let some pop music back in my life and swung back from my nearly complete nihilism to embrace local and organic food. I guess we\'re into the Clinton years now and I didn\'t really pay much attention to politics. They\'d backed down on the war on drugs some, so what was a little Bosnian crisis? Honestly, both parties sucked (it was the \"system\") and I was frustrated as hell, looking for a revolution and getting wasted.\r\n\r\nIn 2000, I voted for Nader. I didn\'t know much and pretty much just voted for the pseudo-viable 3rd party candidate. Bush won.\r\n\r\n9-11. Devastating. But I considered it pure blow back.\r\n\r\n2004; Voted for Kerry (against Bush). Bush won.\r\n\r\nBush/Cheney/Rove were teh evil. I felt a lot more strongly about this before Obama extended the Patriot Act, etc.\r\n\r\nEarly 2008: Started watching Daily/Colbert, which was the closest thing I\'d done to paying attention to news in years.\r\n\r\n2008: Voted for Obama. I\'m not one of those who had no idea what he was about. I thought universal health care was a good idea. I\'d argued with my parents how the increased size of the pot would help everyone. Similar on other issues.\r\n\r\nFeb-Mar. 2009: I think it started with his backtracking on FISA. I was hesitant to vote for Obama in the first place, as I didn\'t think he was radical enough, but I was also concerned about his honesty and follow-through, so when I saw him back-pedalling on FISA, I sought out what the \"other side\" was saying about Obama. I didn\'t go to Rush or Fox, I went to 4chan/b/ and someone provided a link to the Alex Jones film \"The Obama Deception\".\r\n\r\nIf you are not familiar with Alex Jones, I generally consider him a nutjob. That said, there were valid accusations among the conspiracy theories. I also must give him credit that in the midst of false flags, psy ops, chem trails, etc., he brings up The Constitution a lot.\r\n\r\nThis got me to read the constitution and think about the founding of this country and limited government. \r\n\r\nStarted listening to Mark Levin and (God forbid) Rush. Coulter is hilarious.\r\n\r\ni can haz rule of law?\r\n\r\n* Among those conservatives was a guy named Matt Foreman, someone I had played with as a child, but I guess we grew apart. He died several years later diving in a nearby quarry.

That ownership has played a key role in the development of the middle class while restraining the growth of government. The repression and thievery in many petrostates occur because the mineral rights are controlled by the kleptocrats, not the people. If the U.S. wants real reform in oil-producing countries, it should be promoting property rights, human rights, and <em>mineral rights</em>. It should be advocating for civil justice systems and the rule of law. Those factors are far more important determinants of the disposition of oil wealth than commodities prices.

By contrast, the Energy Information      Administration  projects that there will be a decline in production of      220,000  barrels of domestic oil per day in 2011, and in 2012 America will       produce 150 million fewer barrels in the Gulf of Mexico, all because of       President Obama’s policies to discourage or ban domestic drilling.  In addition,      President Obama’s drilling moratorium (and subsequent  refusal to issue      drilling permits) has <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/congoNews/idAFN2726555420110127\">forced      at least 7 rigs to leave the Gulf</a> and sign contracts in other countries,      taking much needed jobs and revenue with them.</blockquote>\r\nJazz\'s article <a href=\"http://hotair.com/archives/2011/03/11/shocker-domestic-oil-production-down-foreign-imports-up/\" target=\"_blank\">Shocker: Domestic Oil Production Down, Foreign Imports Up</a>, links to this report from the House Natural Resources Committee: <a href=\"http://naturalresources.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=228278\" target=\"_blank\">EIA Short Term Energy Outlook: Gulf of Mexico Production Down, U.S. Oil Imports Up</a>\r\n<blockquote><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C.,               March 8, 2011</strong> -             Today, the Department of Energy’s independent U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) released their latest <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/emeu/steo/pub/contents.html\" target=\"_blank\">Short Term Energy Outlook</a> for projected crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and net U.S. imports (see charts below). Despite the <a href=\"http://naturalresources.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=227165\">misleading comments</a> made by Interior Secretary Salazar last week, GOM crude oil production  has continued to significantly decline since the Obama Administration’s <em>de facto</em> moratorium. EIA’s latest numbers also show the Obama Administration’s  anti-energy policies have made us more vulnerable to energy price spikes  as we have become increasingly reliant on unstable foreign energy.<em>“The numbers don’t lie—it’s clear that this Administration is  taking U.S. energy policy in exactly in the wrong direction. Gas prices  are closing in on $4 per gallon and thousands of people are out of work  in the Gulf because of the de facto moratorium on drilling permits,”</em> <strong>said Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings</strong>. <em>“Unemployment  is only going to get worse as this Administration’s policies continue  to increase the cost of gasoline, which trickles down to every sector of  our economy. We need to use our resources to produce American made  energy, create good jobs, and insulate ourselves from uncontrollable  energy prices spikes.”</em>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://naturalresources.house.gov/UploadedPhotos/MediumResolution/1700d00e-c65c-46ef-8ff9-d6932bf6c1ee.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://naturalresources.house.gov/UploadedPhotos/MediumResolution/40cdeec2-bdaa-4df7-af8a-5ed8a9fc201a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" /></blockquote>\r\nTapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserves in response to rising prices is like someone losing their job and responding by spending their savings without looking for another job.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Lies and Nonsense from Obama', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'lies-and-nonsense-from-obama', '', '', '2011-03-12 19:03:33', '2011-03-12 19:03:33', '', 0, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/?p=127', 0, 'post', '', 0),

President Obama      is deliberately trying to take  credit for actions unrelated to his      policies. The increased level  of production is due to the actions of <a href=\"http://naturalresources.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=228625\">previous      administrations</a> and production in the Dakotas where most drilling is      occurring on  private land. By contrast, the Energy Information      Administration  projects that there will be a decline in production of      220,000  barrels of domestic oil per day in 2011, and in 2012 America will       produce 150 million fewer barrels in the Gulf of Mexico, all because of       President Obama’s policies to discourage or ban domestic drilling.  In addition,      President Obama’s drilling moratorium (and subsequent  refusal to issue      drilling permits) has <a href=\"http://af.reuters.com/article/congoNews/idAFN2726555420110127\">forced      at least 7 rigs to leave the Gulf</a> and sign contracts in other countries,      taking much needed jobs and revenue with them.</blockquote>\r\nJazz\'s article <a href=\"http://hotair.com/archives/2011/03/11/shocker-domestic-oil-production-down-foreign-imports-up/\" target=\"_blank\">Shocker: Domestic Oil Production Down, Foreign Imports Up</a>, links to this report from the House Natural Resources Committee: <a href=\"http://naturalresources.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=228278\" target=\"_blank\">EIA Short Term Energy Outlook: Gulf of Mexico Production Down, U.S. Oil Imports Up</a>\r\n<blockquote><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C.,               March 8, 2011</strong> -             Today, the Department of Energy’s independent U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) released their latest <a href=\"http://www.eia.gov/emeu/steo/pub/contents.html\" target=\"_blank\">Short Term Energy Outlook</a> for projected crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) and net U.S. imports (see charts below). Despite the <a href=\"http://naturalresources.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=227165\">misleading comments</a> made by Interior Secretary Salazar last week, GOM crude oil production  has continued to significantly decline since the Obama Administration’s <em>de facto</em> moratorium. EIA’s latest numbers also show the Obama Administration’s  anti-energy policies have made us more vulnerable to energy price spikes  as we have become increasingly reliant on unstable foreign energy.<em>“The numbers don’t lie—it’s clear that this Administration is  taking U.S. energy policy in exactly in the wrong direction. Gas prices  are closing in on $4 per gallon and thousands of people are out of work  in the Gulf because of the de facto moratorium on drilling permits,”</em> <strong>said Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings</strong>. <em>“Unemployment  is only going to get worse as this Administration’s policies continue  to increase the cost of gasoline, which trickles down to every sector of  our economy. We need to use our resources to produce American made  energy, create good jobs, and insulate ourselves from uncontrollable  energy prices spikes.”</em>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://naturalresources.house.gov/UploadedPhotos/MediumResolution/1700d00e-c65c-46ef-8ff9-d6932bf6c1ee.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" />\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://naturalresources.house.gov/UploadedPhotos/MediumResolution/40cdeec2-bdaa-4df7-af8a-5ed8a9fc201a.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" /></blockquote>\r\nTapping into the Strategic Petroleum Reserves in response to rising prices is like someone losing their job and responding by spending their savings without looking for another job.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Lies and Nonsense from Obama', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '127-revision-9', '', '', '2011-03-12 15:42:35', '2011-03-12 15:42:35', '', 127, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2011/03/12/127-revision-9/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Specifically, the unrealistic and unprecedented GDP predictions. From the article:\r\n<blockquote>There’s a bit of an understatement in there that blows a rather gaping  hole in the entire plan. When the CBO says that a revenue figure of 23  percent of GDP would be “much higher than has typically been seen in  recent decades” it fails to note that <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703514904575602943209741952.html\">we have </a><em><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703514904575602943209741952.html\">never</a></em><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703514904575602943209741952.html\"> seen a revenue figure larger than 20.9 percent of GDP</a>. Furthermore, even when the top marginal tax rate was over 90 percent, we still didn’t crack <a href=\"http://www.sundriesshack.com/2010/12/06/what-would-it-take-to-balance-the-budget-a-lot-less-work-than-we-think/\">a 60-year average of 19.5 percent of GDP</a>.  In other words, the CBO’s alternative plan on which Klein pins his  hopes assumes that the government will take in at least 3 percentage  points more of all the goods and services we create in a year than we’ve  <em>ever</em> taken and that we’ll keep taking <em>at least</em> that much for the next <em>80 years</em>.  Oh, and if you’re wondering how revenues have been looking lately, what  with all the new taxes and fees rolled out by the Democrats over the  last two years, <a href=\"http://www.gpoaccess.gov/usbudget/fy12/hist.html\">you can find that here in Table 2.3</a>.  We took in 14.9 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010, down over 2.5  percentage points from the year before. In fact, we haven’t hit that  19.5 percent average since 2001.</blockquote>\r\nBut just ignore that, Ezra. Federal revenue as a percentage of GDP will rise on the wings of hope and change as they never have before.\r\n\r\nWhen not proposing his own elegant solution, Klein has been attacking <a href=\"http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/Plan/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Ryan\'s Roadmap</a> as <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/column-ryans-bad-joke/2011/04/12/AFyvg2PD_blog.html\" target=\"_blank\">a bad joke</a>. Thankfully, Jennifer Rubin (also of the Washington Post) takes his critique to task in <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/paul-ryans-desperate-critics/2011/03/29/AFuK0ISD_blog.html\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Ryan\'s Desperate Critics</a>, exposing outright dishonesty or a lack of comprehension on Klein\'s part. Just a sampling:\r\n<blockquote>Ezra also pronounces, “The wealthy, meanwhile, would see their taxes  lowered, and the Defense Department would escape unscathed.” These  assertions are wrong. The <em>president</em> preserved the Bush tax cuts;  the Republicans propose keeping rates where they are and going after  corporate welfare that benefits the rich. In a revenue-neutral reform  with lower rates, itemized deductions (which benefit the rich) would be  removed or limited. Ezra is also wrong on defense. On this Ryan and the  president agree to implement the <em>cuts</em> proposed by Defense Secretary Robert Gates.</blockquote>\r\nIs Paul Ryan\'s plan perfect? I doubt it, but it seems to me a serious proposal and a starting point for real discussion about hard economic issues facing our country.

I still light up when I hear early KISS.\r\n\r\nIn lunch line in elementary school (2nd or 3rd grade), a friend asked me if I liked ELO (Electric Light Orchestra). I\'d never heard of them and misunderstood him and said \"Yellow is awesome, I love Yellow!\" I don\'t think he corrected me at the time, but it was a humbling moment when I recognized my error.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Env5iMrBjws\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailymotion.com/video/x21d8b_elo-don-t-bring-me-down_music\r\n\r\nI\'ve worked really hard to eliminate lying for the sake of flattery since then.

I brought it home and was reading the label, when I saw that in addition to boasting of its lack of rBST, it had the following note: <em>no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST and non rBST treated cows.</em> So it was fortuitous that moments later, I found an article that explained the history of that note.\r\n\r\nI\'m not anti-agricultural technology. Modern agriculture allows us to feed more people more economically than any other method. Organics are a luxury that I indulge in as I do think they are generally better. I\'m not sure of their overall ecological impact compared to modern farming, especially if you throw in whether there\'s enough food or not. I\'m more excited about local food, organic or not, which clearly diminishes the transportation footprint.\r\n\r\nTo me, that label on my milk carton is cronyism. There\'s an hour and fifty minute documentary basically purporting that Monsanto is straight up evil, <a href=\"http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-world-according-to-monsanto/\" target=\"_blank\">The World According to Monsanto</a>, which should be taken with a grain of salt, but the revolving door of Michael R. Taylor (see below) seems pretty shady to me.\r\n\r\nThe article goes on to explain how <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-s510/show\" target=\"_blank\">The Food Safety Modernization Act (S510) </a>will, in the author\'s words, \"undermine the small farmers, the organic farmers, by mandating cost-prohibitive reporting, evaluating, monitoring and maintaining of records to comply with these rules and “prohibits” those operations that are not considered to be in compliance.\"\r\n\r\nWhile we\'re on the subject, I\'m <a href=\"http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/gmfood/overview.php\" target=\"_blank\">ambivalent</a> about GMOs a/k/a \"frankenfoods\".\r\n\r\nFrom <a href=\"http://biggovernment.com/lrlee/2011/05/09/tea-party-and-hippies-unite-food-safety-and-the-presidents-food-safety-czar/\" target=\"_blank\">BigGovernment</a>:\r\n<blockquote>Why has the Food Safety Modernization Act (S510) encountered opposition from the Tea Partiers and their unlikely ally, the hippy, natural food, organic farmer, granola crowd?  Look at the history of the FDA and see if they truly have the best interests of America’s health and food safety at the core of their concerns.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://biggovernment.com/files/2011/05/organic_dairy.jpg\"><img title=\"organic_dairy\" src=\"http://biggovernment.com/files/2011/05/organic_dairy.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"387\" height=\"290\" /></a>\r\n\r\nIn the early 1990s the FDA was constructing their genetically modified organisms (GMO) policy.  During the Clinton Administration Michael R. Taylor was appointed policy chief at the FDA, whose job it was to make policy with regards to these GMOs.  Prior to working at the FDA he had been Monsanto’s attorney. One of the products of <a href=\"http://www.monsanto.com/americasfarmers/Pages/default.aspx?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=%22monsanto%22&amp;utm_content=%21acq%21263963343-5265978634&amp;utm_campaign=Monsanto+Campaign+-+Branded\">Monsanto</a> was <a href=\"http://www.elanco.us/products/posilac.htm\">Posilac,</a> which is the brand name of recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) also known as recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST).  This product, when injected into dairy cows, causes them to produce 10 to 15% more milk on average.  This was marketed as a safe drug to increase milk production and therefore increase revenues for dairy farmers.  Michael R. Taylor declared all GMOs, including rBGH/rBST, to be essentially identical to the natural product and therefore safe for human consumption, <em>even though</em><em> no safety studies were done</em>. In late1993 Monsanto received permission from the FDA to market Posilac.\r\n\r\nFarmers began purchasing Posilac and injecting their cows and found that it did indeed cause the cows to increase their milk production.  What they also discovered is that these cows began to suffer with mastitis (infected udders) continuously and they had to inject them with antibiotics to fight these infections, resulting in pus being present in the milk the cows produced.  They also suffered with fertility problems, hoof diseases and lameness among other illnesses.  The cows were producing milk constantly and were living shorter, unhealthier lives.  The farmers decided that the health of their cows was not worth the increased profits and began to market their milk products as not containing milk from rBGH or rBST treated cows.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/GuidanceDocuments/FoodLabelingNutrition/ucm059036.htm\">FDA</a> took swift action, at the insistence of Monsanto, and told them that if they were going to continue to label their products, they must also add the statement that “<em>no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST and non rBST treated cows.”</em> rBST/rBGH can be found in milk, ice cream, ice milk, frozen yogurt, yogurt, baby formula, cereals, cheese, cream cheese.  Think powdered milk products, too.</blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"http://biggovernment.com/lrlee/2011/05/09/tea-party-and-hippies-unite-food-safety-and-the-presidents-food-safety-czar/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the rest at BigGovernment</a>', 'Tea Party and Hippies Unite: Food Safety and the President’s Food Safety Czar', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'tea-party-and-hippies-unite-food-safety-and-the-president%e2%80%99s-food-safety-czar', '', '', '2011-05-09 20:09:33', '2011-05-09 20:09:33', '', 0, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/?p=312', 0, 'post', '', 0),

In late1993 Monsanto received permission from the FDA to market Posilac.\r\n\r\nFarmers began purchasing Posilac and injecting their cows and found that it did indeed cause the cows to increase their milk production.  What they also discovered is that these cows began to suffer with mastitis (infected udders) continuously and they had to inject them with antibiotics to fight these infections, resulting in pus being present in the milk the cows produced.  They also suffered with fertility problems, hoof diseases and lameness among other illnesses.  The cows were producing milk constantly and were living shorter, unhealthier lives.  The farmers decided that the health of their cows was not worth the increased profits and began to market their milk products as not containing milk from rBGH or rBST treated cows.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/GuidanceDocuments/FoodLabelingNutrition/ucm059036.htm\">FDA</a> took swift action, at the insistence of Monsanto, and told them that if they were going to continue to label their products, they must also add the statement that “<em>no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rBST and non rBST treated cows.”</em> rBST/rBGH can be found in milk, ice cream, ice milk, frozen yogurt, yogurt, baby formula, cereals, cheese, cream cheese.  Think powdered milk products, too.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://biggovernment.com/lrlee/2011/05/09/tea-party-and-hippies-unite-food-safety-and-the-presidents-food-safety-czar/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the rest</a>', 'Tea Party and Hippies Unite: Food Safety and the President’s Food Safety Czar', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '312-revision-3', '', '', '2011-05-09 18:55:25', '2011-05-09 18:55:25', '', 312, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2011/05/09/312-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

We need to be vigilant  to keep our land, air, and waters free of real pollution, particulates,  heavy metals, and pathogens, but carbon dioxide (CO2 ) is not one of  these pollutants. Carbon is the stuff of life. Our bodies are made of  carbon. A normal human exhales around 1 kg of CO2 (the simplest  chemically stable molecule of carbon in the earth’s atmosphere) per day.  Before the industrial period, the concentration of CO2 in the  atmosphere was 270 ppm. At the present time, the concentration is about  390 ppm, 0.039 percent of all atmospheric molecules and less than 1  percent of that in our breath. About fifty million years ago, a brief  moment in the long history of life on earth, geological evidence  indicates, CO2 levels were several thousand ppm, much higher than now.  And life flourished abundantly.</blockquote>\r\n~snip~\r\n<blockquote>What, besides the bias toward a particular result, is wrong with the  science? Scientific progress proceeds by the interplay of theory and  observation. Theory explains observations and makes predictions about  what will be observed in the future. Observations anchor our  understanding and weed out the theories that don’t work. This has been  the scientific method for more than three hundred years. Recently, the  advent of the computer has made possible another branch of inquiry:  computer simulation models. Properly used, computer models can enhance  and speed up scientific progress. But they are not meant to replace  theory and observation and to serve as an authority of their own. We  know they fail in economics. All of the proposed controls that would  have such a significant impact on the world’s economic future are based  on computer models that are so complex and chaotic that many runs are  needed before we can get an “average” answer. Yet the models have failed  the simple scientific test of prediction. We don’t even have a theory  for how accurate the models should be.</blockquote>\r\n~snip~\r\n<blockquote>In our efforts to conserve the created world, we should not concentrate  our efforts on CO2. We should instead focus on issues like damage to  local landscapes and waterways by strip mining, inadequate cleanup,  hazards to miners, and the release of real pollutants and poisons like  mercury, other heavy metals, and organic carcinogens. Much of the  potential harm from coal mining can be eliminated, for example, by  requirements that land be restored to a condition that is at least as  good as, and preferably better than, when the mining began.</blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.firstthings.com/article/2011/05/the-truth-about-greenhouse-gases\" target=\"_blank\">Read the rest</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'The Truth About Greenhouse Gases', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'the-truth-about-greenhouse-gases', '', '', '2011-05-21 18:20:17', '2011-05-21 18:20:17', '', 0, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/?p=390', 0, 'post', '', 0),

During the argument, Mary tried to call her sister but Barnes grabbed the phone from her hand and threw it against the wall. Mary called 911 from her cell phone and informed the dispatcher that Barnes was throwing things around the apartment but that he had not struck her. The 911 dispatch went out as a \"domestic violence in progress.\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Lenny Reed, the first responder, saw a man leaving an apartment with a bag and began questioning him in the parking lot. Upon identifying the man as Barnes, Reed informed him that officers were responding to a 911 call. Barnes responded that he was getting his things and leaving and that Reed was not needed. Barnes had raised his voice and yelled at Reed, prompting stares from others outside and several warnings from Reed.\r\n\r\nOfficer Jason Henry arrived on the scene and observed that Barnes was \"very agitated and was yelling.\"  Barnes \"continued to yell, loudly\" and did not lower his voice until Reed warned that he would be arrested for disorderly conduct. Barnes retorted, \"if you lock me up for Disorderly Conduct, you‘re going to be sitting right next to me in a jail cell.\" Mary came onto the parking lot, threw a black duffle bag in Barnes‘s direction, told him to take the rest of his stuff, and returned to the apartment. Reed and Henry followed Barnes back to the apartment. Mary entered the apartment, followed by Barnes, who then turned around and blocked the doorway. Barnes told the officers that they could not enter the apartment and denied Reed‘s requests to enter and investigate. Mary did not explicitly invite the officers in, but she told Barnes several times, \"don‘t do this\" and \"just let them in.\" Reed attempted to enter the apartment, and Barnes shoved him against the wall. A struggle ensued, and the officers used a choke hold and a taser to subdue and arrest Barnes. Barnes suffered an adverse reaction to the taser and was taken to the hospital.\r\n\r\nBarnes was charged with Class A misdemeanor battery on a police officer, Class A misdemeanor resisting law enforcement, Class B misdemeanor disorderly conduct, and Class A misdemeanor interference with the reporting of a crime. Before the trial, Barnes tendered a jury instruction on the right of a citizen to reasonably resist unlawful entry into the citizen‘s home. The trial court refused Barnes‘s instruction and did not otherwise instruct the jury as to the right to reasonably resist. The jury found Barnes guilty of battery on a police officer, resisting law enforcement, and disorderly conduct.\r\n\r\nBarnes appealed, challenging the trial court‘s refusal to give his tendered jury instruction\r\nand the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his convictions. The Court of Appeals found that\r\nthe trial court‘s refusal of Barnes‘s tendered jury instruction was not harmless error. Barnes v.\r\nState, 925 N.E.2d 420, 426 (Ind. Ct. App. 2010). The Court of Appeals also found that the\r\nevidence was insufficient to sustain the disorderly conduct conviction. Id. at 426–29. The Court\r\nof Appeals therefore ordered a new trial on the battery and resisting charges. Id. at 429.

During the argument, Mary tried to call her sister but Barnes grabbed the phone from her hand and threw it against the wall. Mary called 911 from her cell phone and informed the dispatcher that Barnes was throwing things around the apartment but that he had not struck her. The 911 dispatch went out as a \"domestic violence in progress.\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Lenny Reed, the first responder, saw a man leaving an apartment with a bag and began questioning him in the parking lot. Upon identifying the man as Barnes, Reed informed him that officers were responding to a 911 call. Barnes responded that he was getting his things and leaving and that Reed was not needed. Barnes had raised his voice and yelled at Reed, prompting stares from others outside and several warnings from Reed.\r\n\r\nOfficer Jason Henry arrived on the scene and observed that Barnes was \"very agitated and was yelling.\"  Barnes \"continued to yell, loudly\" and did not lower his voice until Reed warned that he would be arrested for disorderly conduct. Barnes retorted, \"if you lock me up for Disorderly Conduct, you‘re going to be sitting right next to me in a jail cell.\" Mary came onto the parking lot, threw a black duffle bag in Barnes‘s direction, told him to take the rest of his stuff, and returned to the apartment. Reed and Henry followed Barnes back to the apartment. Mary entered the apartment, followed by Barnes, who then turned around and blocked the doorway. Barnes told the officers that they could not enter the apartment and denied Reed‘s requests to enter and investigate. Mary did not explicitly invite the officers in, but she told Barnes several times, \"don‘t do this\" and \"just let them in.\" Reed attempted to enter the apartment, and Barnes shoved him against the wall. A struggle ensued, and the officers used a choke hold and a taser to subdue and arrest Barnes. Barnes suffered an adverse reaction to the taser and was taken to the hospital.</blockquote>', 'Indiana Supreme Court on Unlawful Police Entry', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '354-revision-6', '', '', '2011-05-14 22:44:49', '2011-05-14 22:44:49', '', 354, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2011/05/14/354-revision-6/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The old man posits that man is essentially a machine whose character is the product of his inborn temperament, outside influences, and nothing else. This makes us no different than animals. The young man tries to argue against these ideas, but all his arguments break down. Other interesting ideas include that there is no life-long search of truth, we only seek until we find something suitable and then spend the rest of our lives defending that truth; that our only goal is to satisfy our hunger for self-approval; and that all our virtues come from God.\r\n\r\nIt\'s not a full book, but not super short, either.

A principle enshrined in the common law and previously  well-founded in the Fourth Amendment -- that \"the physical entry of the  home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment  is directed\" -- was decided by the three member majority to be  \"superseded\" by modern jurisprudence.\n\nThe three-member majority explains why it is ignoring the longstanding (and current) precedent under the U.S. Constitution:\n<blockquote>We believe however that a right to resist an unlawful police entry into a home <strong>is against public policy</strong> and is incompatible with modern Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  Nowadays, an aggrieved arrestee has means unavailable at common law for  redress against unlawful police action. E.g . . . the following modern  developments: (1) bail, (2) prompt arraignment and determination of  probable cause, (3) the exclusionary rule, (4) police department  internal review and disciplinary procedure, and (5) civil remedies. We  also find that allowing resistance unnecessarily escalates the level of  violence and therefore the risk of injuries to all parties involved  without preventing the arrest.</blockquote>\nThe dissenting judges noted that the majority was abandoning both a  bedrock principle of the Fourth Amendment and that there was no need to  depart so drastically even if they were hell-bent on ruling against this  particular defendant (who seems pretty darn unsympathetic). The more  obvious rule would be that which the U.S. Supreme Court and other states  have applied: there is a right to resist unlawful police entry so long  as the force used is <em>reasonable</em>.\n\nSuch a \"reasonable man\" rule is employed in many parts of the law and is  frequently put to juries to decide. Something tells me these jurists  wanted to take that determination entirely out of the hands of simple  jurors...\n\nLawgeeks will want to take a look at both dissents <a href=\"http://www.in.gov/judiciary/opinions/pdf/05121101shd.pdf\">here (PDF).</a></blockquote>\nFrom Washington Times:', 'Wait ...

Twenty-six years after its 1932 publication, Huxley wrote <em>Brave New World Revisited</em> to marvel at how many of his book’s outlandish futurist predictions had already come true — things like <em>in vitro</em> fertilization and psychopharmacology.\r\n\r\nBut if Huxley were alive today, he’d have to write <em> Brave New World Re-Revisited</em> to account for the new elementary school curriculum in Basel, Switzerland. Because what Huxley predicted would happen by 2540 A.D. has already come true in 2011 — 529 years ahead of schedule.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nI can no longer deny what I’ve long merely suspected: That many “progressive” educators use mandatory public school sex education specifically for the purpose of indoctrinating entire generations of children into being promiscuous as early as possible. Why? To cause the breakdown of the nuclear family, to pave the road for a Brave New World.</blockquote>\r\n<a href=\"http://pajamasmedia.com/zombie/2011/08/26/brave-new-world-arrives-ahead-of-schedule-sex-indoctrination-for-toddlers/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the whole thing.</a> And check out Zombie\'s posting in the comments (about five down from the top) for links to even creepier things.\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, over at <a href=\"http://ace.mu.nu/\" target=\"_blank\">AoSHQ</a>, Ace has a thought-provoking post, <a href=\"http://minx.cc/?post=320620\" target=\"_blank\">This Is Why The Argument Over Michelle Obama Confuses Me (And Why I Am Often Confused In Arguments</a>\r\n<blockquote>There is tendency among conservatives -- particularly <em>now</em> -- to cast virtually every single discussion of <em>policy</em> in terms of whether or not the state even has this power in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, I think this is a sanguinary development. Conservatives keep saying, \"Why are we assuming, as an initial matter, the government needs to act at all, and instead proceeding directly to questions of <em>in what manner shall it act?</em>\"\r\n\r\nI actually agree with that. I think that is long overdue. We need to have that discussion. Every new law should begin at Step 0. Not Step 1. Step 0 -- an inquiry into a, does the government have this power? and b, even conceding it does have this power, is it urgent that it should exercise this power?\r\n\r\nHowever, we seem to have ventured into an Undiscovered Country in which things I <em>know for a fact are constitutional and have always been done by the state (or state<strong>s</strong></em>) -- since the days when we were colonists; since the Articles of Confederation; since the Constitution; since the Golden Age of libertarian thought in the 1920s -- are now simply being claimed to be unconstitutional, <em>without even an argument as to how this surprising conclusion came to be held.</em>\r\n\r\nI think arguments are getting <em>very</em> sloppy here. I think disputes that are accurately about <em>proper <strong>policy</strong></em> keep morphing into arguments about general philosophical/theoretical arguments about the power of the state, and furthermore, we seem to be frequently steering into wildly ahistorical territory in asserting, without evidence, <em>The state never had x power.</em></blockquote>\r\nAgain, <a href=\"http://minx.cc/?post=320620\" target=\"_blank\">read the rest</a> and check out the lively discussion in the comments.', 'A Couple Good Reads', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'a-couple-good-reads', '', '', '2011-08-27 22:02:07', '2011-08-27 22:02:07', '', 0, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/?p=476', 0, 'post', '', 0),

Even if he were alive in 1997 (when Gang Related came out), he still made 5 movies in 6 years in addition to his prolific rapping, etc. Similarly with the later releases, a fan could often go back and say, \"This tracks from the 2Pacalypse era, this one is more Makaveli, ...\"\r\n\r\nIt\'s not like any of the posthumous lyrics are like these:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eLABXmjySE', '2Pac', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '488-revision-2', '', '', '2011-09-19 23:12:41', '2011-09-19 23:12:41', '', 488, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2011/09/19/488-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

My Mom was from a Presbyterian/Methodist background and my Dad was Southern Baptist (roughly). I\'m not sure how they ended up there, but I was baptized there, my mom worked there for a while and volunteered as well, I was active in the youth group (partially due to some awesome people: I\'m looking at you Ned, Traci, Amy, Grimmie, Stickle, Tami, McFarland, Loui, etc.)  I still remember my first real discussion with an honest-to-goodness atheist (Alan Federman) my freshman year in college and my incredulity that he could reject Jesus, let alone God.\r\n\r\nAs fate would have it, I was interested in Anthropology and didn\'t give much though to my job prospects, so I majored in it. In addition to the requirements, I padded my classes with Religious Studies, Sociology, Folklore and similar disciplines (the line between them is pretty blurry). I took a class in Buddhism and studied Taoism in my spare time. I appreciated my friend\'s \"Born Again Pagan\" T-shirt. All religions being equal, though the cool ones were exotic. And <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Physics-Exploration-Parallels-Anniversary/dp/1570625190\" target=\"_blank\">Taoism and physics</a> were identical.\r\n\r\nPoint being, I  can\'t pinpoint when I went from incredulity at doubting the Gospel to seriously doubting it myself, but it was somewhere in the late college years or soon thereafter (\'89-93).\r\n\r\nThe years 1993-2010 are difficult to describe. You could call them the lost (wilderness, to be biblical) years. The exotic lost its luster and I probably described myself as agnostic. I found it a little insensitive when \"God\" was mentioned at family gatherings. Around 2009, a co-worker (and friend) recommended going to her (I\'m thinking it\'s the Unitarian Universal) church. I responded by saying I was currently debating whether I was an Apatheist (not sure if there\'s a god or not, but trying to be a good person) or a Pretenditarian (not sure if there\'s a God, but pretending there is is often convenient).', 'My Religious History', '', 'draft', 'open', 'open', '', '', '', '', '2011-12-09 01:03:45', '2011-12-09 01:03:45', '', 0, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/?p=529', 0, 'post', '', 0),

My Mom was from a Presbyterian/Methodist background and my Dad was Southern Baptist (roughly). I\'m not sure how they ended up there, but I was baptized there, my mom worked there for a while and volunteered as well, I was active in the youth group (partially due to some awesome people: I\'m looking at you Ned, Traci, Amy, Grimmie, Stickle, Tami, McFarland, Loui, etc.)  I still remember my first real discussion with an honest-to-goodness atheist (Alan Federman) my freshman year in college and my incredulity that he could reject Jesus, let alone God.\n\nAs fate would have it, I was interested in Anthropology and didn\'t give much though to my job prospects, so I majored in it. In addition to the requirements, I padded my classes with Religious Studies, Sociology, Folklore and similar disciplines (the line between them is pretty blurry). I took a class in Buddhism and studied Taoism in my spare time. I appreciated my friend\'s \"Born Again Pagan\" T-shirt. All religions being equal, though the cool ones were exotic. And <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Tao-Physics-Exploration-Parallels-Anniversary/dp/1570625190\" target=\"_blank\">Taoism and physics</a> were identical.\n\nPoint being, I  can\'t pinpoint when I went from incredulity at doubting the Gospel to seriously doubting it myself, but it was somewhere in the late college years or soon thereafter (\'89-93).\n\nThe years 1993-2010 are difficult to describe. You could call them the lost (wilderness, to be biblical) years. The exotic lost its luster and I probably described myself as agnostic. I found it a little insensitive when \"God\" was mentioned at family gatherings. Around 2009, a co-worker (and friend) recommended going to her (I\'m thinking it\'s the Unitarian Universal) church. I responded by saying I was currently debating whether I was an Apatheist (not sure if there\'s a god or not, but trying to be a good person) or a Pretenditarian (not sure if there\'s a God, but pretending there is is often convenient).', 'My Religious History', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '529-revision', '', '', '2011-12-09 00:09:23', '2011-12-09 00:09:23', '', 529, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2011/12/09/529-revision/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

We don\'t part the Red Sea but we walk through the hood without getting shot. We don\'t turn water to wine but we turn dope fiends and dope heads into productive citizens of society. We turn words into money. What greater gift can there be. So I belive God blesses us, I belive God blesses those that hustle. Those that use their minds and those that overall are righteous. I belive that everything you do bad comes back to you. So everything that I do that\'s bad, I\'m going to suffer for it. But in my heart, I belive what I\'m doing in my heart is right.

If God wanted to talk to me in a pretty spot like that, why the hell he send me here then. That makes ghetto kids not belive in God. Why? So that\'s wrong religion-I belive in God, I belive God puts us where ever we want to be at. They didn\'t make sense that God would put us in the ghetto. That means he wants us to work hard to get up out of here. That means he\'s testing us even more. That makes sense that if you\'re good in your heart, you\'re closer to God but if you\'re evil than your closer to the devil; that makes sense! I see that everyday all that other spooky shit, don\'t make sense. I don\'t even belive, I\'m not dissin\' them but I don\'t belive in the brothers, I\'ve been in jail with \'em and having conversations with brothers; \"I\'m God, I\'m God.\" You God, open the gate for me.

I try to pray to God every night unless I pass out. I learned this in jail, I talked to every God (member of the Five Percent Nation) there was in jail. I think that if you take one of the \"O\'s\" out of \"Good\" it\'s \"God\", if you add a \"D\" to \"Evil\", it\'s the \"Devil\". I think some cool motherfucker sat down a long time ago and said let\'s figure out a way to control motherfuckers. That\'s what they came up with-the bible. Cause if God wrote the bible, I\'m sure there would have been a revised copy by now. Cause a lot of shit has changed. I\'ve been looking for this revised copy-I still see that same old copy that we had from then. I\'m not disrespecting anyone\'s religion, please forgive me if it comes off that way, I\'m just stating my opinion. The bible tells us that all these did this because they suffered so much that\'s what makes them special people. I got shot five times and I got crucified to the media. And I walked through with the thorns on and I had shit thrown on me and I had the theif at the top; I told that nigga \"I\'ll be back for you. Trust me, is not supposed to be going down, I\'ll be back. I\'m not saying I\'m Jesus but I\'m saying we go through that type of thing everyday. We don\'t part the Red Sea but we walk through the hood without getting shot. We don\'t turn water to wine but we turn dope fiends and dope heads into productive citizens of society. We turn words into money. What greater gift can there be. So I belive God blesses us, I belive God blesses those that hustle. Those that use their minds and those that overall are righteous. I belive that everything you do bad comes back to you. So everything that I do that\'s bad, I\'m going to suffer for it. But in my heart, I belive what I\'m doing in my heart is right. So I feel like I\'m going to heaven. I think heaven is just when you sleep, you sleep with a good conscience-you don\'t have nightmares. Hell is when you sleep, the last thing you see is all the fucked up things you did in your life and you just see it over and over again, cause you don\'t burn. If that\'s the case, it\'s hell on earth cause bullets burn. There\'s people that got burned in fires, does that mean they went to hell already? All that is here. What do you got there that we ain\'t seen here? What, we\'re gonna walk around aimlessly like zombies? That\'s here! You ain\'t been on the streets lately? Heaven now, look! (reffering to his plush apartment) we\'re sitting up here in the living room-big screen TV- this is heaven, for the moment. Hell is jail I seen that one. Trust me, this is what\'s real. And all that other shit is to control you. If the churches took half the money that they was making and gave it back to the community, we\'d be alright. If they took half the buildings that they use to \"praise God\" and gave it to motherfuckers who need God, we\'d be alright. Have you seen some of these got damn churches lately? There\'s one\'s that take up the whole block in New York. There\'s homeless people out here. Why ain\'t God lettin\' them stay there? Why these niggas got gold ceilings and shit? Why God need gold ceilings to talk to me? Why does God need colored windows to talk to me? Why God can\'t come where I\'m at where he sent me? If God wanted to talk to me in a pretty spot like that, why the hell he send me here then. That makes ghetto kids not belive in God. Why? So that\'s wrong religion-I belive in God, I belive God puts us where ever we want to be at. They didn\'t make sense that God would put us in the ghetto. That means he wants us to work hard to get up out of here. That means he\'s testing us even more. That makes sense that if you\'re good in your heart, you\'re closer to God but if you\'re evil than your closer to the devil; that makes sense! I see that everyday all that other spooky shit, don\'t make sense. I don\'t even belive, I\'m not dissin\' them but I don\'t belive in the brothers, I\'ve been in jail with \'em and having conversations with brothers; \"I\'m God, I\'m God.\" You God, open the gate for me.

Mark Levin has made the point: What if you had a living mortage, whose terms could be arbitrarily adapted to suit the times? How would that work? No. The mortgage is a contract. You can amend it (refinance?), but it says what it says.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with a 200+ old year mortgage, the terms can be harder to decipher. Hence, originalism doesn\'t resolve all the conflicts, it just provides a framework for and limit on interpretation.\r\n\r\nWikipedia provides a nice example:\r\n<blockquote>Suppose that the Constitution contained (which it obviously does not) a provision that a person may not be \"subjected to the punishments of hanging by the neck, beheading, stoning, pressing, or execution by firing squad\". A strict constructionist would interpret that clause to mean that the specific punishments mentioned above were unconstitutional, but that other forms of capital punishment were permissible. For a strict constructionist, the specific, strict reading of the text is the beginning and end of the inquiry.\r\n\r\nFor an Originalist, however, the text is the beginning of the inquiry, and two Originalists might reach very different results, not only from the strict constructionist, but from each other. \"Originalists can reach different results in the same case\" (see What Originalism is Not — Originalism is not always an answer in and of itself, infra); one originalist might look at the context in which the clause was written, and might discover that the punishments listed in the clause were the only forms of capital punishment in use at that time, and the only forms of capital punishment that had ever been used at the time of ratification. An originalist might therefore conclude that capital punishment in general—including those methods for it invented since ratification, such as the electric chair—are not constitutional. Another originalist may look at the text and see that the writers created a list. He would assume that the Congress intended this to be an exhaustive list of objectionable executions. Otherwise, they would have banned capital punishment as a whole, instead of listing specific means of punishment. He would rule that other forms of execution are constitutional.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph above does not give examples of Original intent vis a vis Original meaning. Using the former, the Judge would look for the letters and journals of the Founders on the subject of capital punishment. If he found that a majority expressed an aversion to it, the interpretation would be averse to capital punishment.

If any form other than those listed was extremely rare, the decision could be averse to all capital punishment.

The exact number is in dispute, but I think those that argue with the the Department of Defense numbers are using shady tricks like considering an off-site daycare center to be a military base. With that in mind, according to the DoD, the number of military bases on foreign soil as of 2011 is 611, the number in 2009 was 716, and in 2004 was 902. For the mathematically challenged, that is a 32.2% decrease from 2004-2011 (OK, I admit, I had to look up the <a href=\"http://calculator.maconstate.edu/percentage_change_lesson/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">mathematical definition of percentage change</a>). So if there are too many bases, at least the number is going in the right direction.\r\n\r\nThere\'s the executive summary.

More than 350 installations have been closed in five BRAC rounds: 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995 and the most recent round of BRAC completed and entered into law in November 2005.</blockquote>\r\nIn 1997, the General Accounting Office (now called the Government Accountability Office (good call)) released <a href=\"http://www.gao.gov/archive/1997/ns97151.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Military Bases: Lessons Learned from Prior Base Closure Rounds</a>. It\'s an interesting read (or skim, in my case), but I thought this got to the heart of the difficulties:\r\n<blockquote>Closing unneeded defense facilities has historically been difficult because of public concern about the economic effects of closures on communities and the perceived lack of impartiality of the decision-making process. It was made even more difficult by legislation enacted in the 1970s that required DOD to notify Congress of proposed closures and to prepare economic, environmental, and strategic consequence reports. These requirements effectively precluded bases from being closed between 1977 and 1988. However, legislation enacted in 1988 (P.L. 100-526) supported a special commission chartered by the Secretary of Defense to identify bases for realignment and closure and provided relief from certain statutory provisions that had hindered DOD\'s past efforts. With this legislation, a BRAC round was completed in 1988. Congress later passed the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (Title XXIX, P.L. 101-510), which created an independent commission and authorized three BRAC rounds in 1991, 1993, and 1995. The four rounds resulted in decisions to close 97 out of 495 major domestic installations and many smaller ones and to realign other facilities. The legislation authorizing these rounds expired at the end of 1995, and DOD\'s authority to close or realign bases reverted to the 1970\'s legislation under which DOD, in effect, was unable to close bases.</blockquote>\r\n<strong>Base Structure Report\r\n</strong>The source for the foreign military base numbers I cited above is called the \"Base Structure Report\", released annually (I think) by the DoD.

The headache this produces is mostly my own, as there are reasonably priced tools such as <a href=\"http://akismet.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Akismet</a> to ease the pain of handling spam, but that\'s not my point. I also point out that I had zero real comments not to complain but to convey that this is not a popular blog. I would imagine the number (~100 per day) would increase if it was more popular.

(604, 1, '2012-01-15 23:48:33', '2012-01-15 23:48:33', 'These are the two major schools of Constitutional interpretation:\r\nOriginalism:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Originalism\r\nLiving Constitution\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_Constitution\r\n\r\nI\'m an originalist and while I understand the living Constitution is a tempting concept, at a certain point, there\'s no longer a basis anymore. Mark Levin has made the point: What if you had a living mortage, whose terms could be arbitrarily adapted to suit the times? How would that work? No. The mortgage is a contract. You can amend it (refinance?), but it says what it says.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, with a 200+ old year mortgage, the terms can be harder to decipher. Hence, originalism doesn\'t resolve all the conflicts, it just provides a framework for and limit on interpretation.\r\n\r\nWikipedia provides a nice example:\r\n<blockquote>Suppose that the Constitution contained (which it obviously does not) a provision that a person may not be \"subjected to the punishments of hanging by the neck, beheading, stoning, pressing, or execution by firing squad\". A strict constructionist would interpret that clause to mean that the specific punishments mentioned above were unconstitutional, but that other forms of capital punishment were permissible. For a strict constructionist, the specific, strict reading of the text is the beginning and end of the inquiry.\r\n\r\nFor an Originalist, however, the text is the beginning of the inquiry, and two Originalists might reach very different results, not only from the strict constructionist, but from each other. \"Originalists can reach different results in the same case\" (see What Originalism is Not — Originalism is not always an answer in and of itself, infra); one originalist might look at the context in which the clause was written, and might discover that the punishments listed in the clause were the only forms of capital punishment in use at that time, and the only forms of capital punishment that had ever been used at the time of ratification. An originalist might therefore conclude that capital punishment in general—including those methods for it invented since ratification, such as the electric chair—are not constitutional. Another originalist may look at the text and see that the writers created a list. He would assume that the Congress intended this to be an exhaustive list of objectionable executions. Otherwise, they would have banned capital punishment as a whole, instead of listing specific means of punishment. He would rule that other forms of execution are constitutional.\r\n\r\nThe paragraph above does not give examples of Original intent vis a vis Original meaning. Using the former, the Judge would look for the letters and journals of the Founders on the subject of capital punishment. If he found that a majority expressed an aversion to it, the interpretation would be averse to capital punishment. Using Original meaning the Judge would look for the frequency of each contemporaneous form of capital punishment. If any form other than those listed was extremely rare, the decision could be averse to all capital punishment. If another form, not listed, was not rare, the decision would have to be in favor of capital punishment because reasonable persons in 1793 would so interpret the clause.</blockquote>\r\nI have a hard time imagining a credible argument against this approach. Oh wait, I just thought of a couple (for liberals): Scalia and Thomas. Actually, I appreciate the judgements I\'ve read of theirs. My point is that even if they are rogues, hi-jacking the term \"originalism\", originalism is (to me) the only approach to the constitution that treats it properly.', 'Constituional Interpretation', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '563-revision-5', '', '', '2012-01-15 23:48:33', '2012-01-15 23:48:33', '', 563, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2012/01/15/563-revision-5/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

And the news is not good for the crisis-mongers.\r\n\r\nFirst we learned that <a href=\"http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre80814t-us-ice-age-emissions/\" target=\"_blank\">the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is actually helping us stave off the next inevitable ice age by a few years</a>. Yes, you read that right: the “runaway global warming” scenario is now off the table; <a href=\"http://hotair.com/archives/2012/01/09/only-you-can-save-earth-from-the-next-ice-age/\" target=\"_blank\">a new ice age is coming for sure</a>, and whatever human warming effects there may be will only make our descent into the deep freeze a little more comfy.\r\n\r\nThen, in a different breakthrough, leading scientists <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/120112142232.htm\" target=\"_blank\">announced the discovery of a heretofore undetected type of molecule in the atmosphere which spurs cloud formation and negates global warming effects</a>. Thanks to something called “Criegee biradicals,” the more we pollute, the more clouds form, and the cooler the planet becomes. Thus, the cumulative effect on the climate due to mankind’s activity: zilch. So for the second time in a week, the entire Anthropogenic Global Warming theory was fatally undermined.\r\n\r\nBut wait! We’re not done. Next up: <a href=\"http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/01/of-orbits-and-ice-ages/\" target=\"_blank\">A study out of Harvard proving that warming and cooling cycles are caused by orbital wobble and precession of the poles</a>; and that the only reason the next ice age hasn’t arrived quite on schedule yet is due to our beneficial increase in carbon dioxide. Yes, that’s right: more data showing that another ice age is inevitable sooner or later.\r\n\r\nA third nail in AGW’s coffin in less than a week? Why wasn’t this front page news?\r\n\r\nBut brace yourself — because those nails in the coffin were just the opening act. The next bit of news was the real blockbuster, a stake through AGW’s heart:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2093264/Forget-global-warming--Cycle-25-need-worry-NASA-scientists-right-Thames-freezing-again.html#ixzz1ku6F2Ksk\" target=\"_blank\">Now we learn that the world has not warmed at all for the last 15 years, and that the entire recent “global warming” hubbub was totally imaginary</a>. Furthermore, the recent cooling is so significant that we may be headed for — you guessed it — a “mini ice age.”\r\n\r\nStill not enough for you? The <em>coup de grace</em> came from our own USDA, which <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/01/26/BU011MUBO0.DTL&amp;tsp=1\" target=\"_blank\">released a new “Plant Hardiness Zone Map” indicating that the mild global warming spike of a few years ago was actually <em>good</em> for plant growth and biodiversity</a>. In other words: Even if we do experience warming, it makes the world a nicer place.\r\n\r\nAnd that was just one week’s news. I wonder what next week will bring?\r\n\r\nNow, you’d think that this devastating barrage of body blows would basically bring an end to the whole Global Warming “controversy.”\r\n\r\nBut no. Because, you see, true believers are nearly impervious to facts. In the midst of all this, the AGW activists and bullies continued their relentless quest to reshape the world’s economic landscape, as if they still had the upper hand. They even <a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/01/30/global-warming-activists-seek-to-purge-deniers-among-local-weathermen/\" target=\"_blank\">launched a witch hunt against “denier” weathermen</a>, threatening to get any TV meteorologists fired unless they present global warming propaganda during their forecasts. Meanwhile, Al Gore continued on his decade-long tirade, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/01/11/al_gore_civilization_at_risk_if_global_warming_is_not_a_campaign_issue.html\" target=\"_blank\">declaring that “civilization is at risk” if the presidential candidates don’t cave into his demands immediately</a>. And if you check the Web sites of any number of climate change nonprofits and organizations, they’re all still in hysterical crisis mode about the coming calamity. To them, you see, news stories like the ones we saw this week may come and go, but Global Warming is forever!</blockquote>\r\nSomeone in the comments of Zombie\'s post (going by \"<a href=\"http://pjmedia.com/zombie/2012/01/31/the-coming-of-the-new-ice-age-end-of-the-global-warming-era/?singlepage=true#comment-266930\" target=\"_blank\">Flaming Liberal</a>\") mentioned an op-ed in the WSJ, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204301404577171531838421366.html?mod=WSJ_article_comments#articleTabs%3Darticle\" target=\"_blank\">No Need to Panic About Global Warming</a>. which was signed by 16 scientists, that had a counter-argument signed by 255 scientists.

They\'ve still failed to put the Anthropogenic in AGW.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I gotta wrap this up.

Orwell\'s vision was of a government ruthlessly suppressing books and changing written accounts of the past in order to change the thinking of the present.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Rick Tempest spoke about this <a href=\"http://minx.cc/?post=340903\">at the end of the most recent AoSHQ podcast.</a> Rick doesn\'t read much, so when he does finish a book, it\'s like The Only Thing He Can Talk About.</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Anyway, Huxley\'s vision was that no totalitarian state was needed for such a descent into infantilization and restriction of thought: That all that was necessary was that the means of distraction and infantilization be provided to the population, and the people would voluntarily <em>choose</em> that path, no Mintruth needed, no black-armored thought police required. Orwell\'s vision was therefore of a forcible lobotomy, conducted by the state; Huxley\'s was one of a <em>voluntary</em> one, people checking in to an outpatient clinic every day to have bothersome parts of their brains excised.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://ace.mu.nu/archives/341009.php\" target=\"_blank\">Read More ...</a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Television and Political Correctness\' Safe Harbor for the Stupid', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '706-revision-3', '', '', '2013-06-19 16:37:08', '2013-06-19 16:37:08', '', 706, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2013/06/19/706-revision-3/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

This was complex for me from the jump, because I generally think that the EPA is out of control and that Americans and American businesses are over-regulated, but the details just cited seem to cry for a more powerful EPA and more regulation. I hope to do a full post on regulation, as my position is nuanced, so to summarize, the context of this tragedy gave me serious pause for thought.\r\n\r\nBut that was just the beginning. I quickly found this article in the <a href=\"http://www.newrepublic.com/article/116206/west-virginia-chemical-spill-sullied-one-states-last-clean-rivers\" target=\"_blank\">New Republic</a>, which further alleges that  coal slurry has forced up to 100,000 residents to abandon private wells to access water from a utility company and (perhaps relatedly),  there is extensive coal industry cronyism and corruption in West Virginia (both in policy legislation and enforcement of that legislation). I have some issues with and doubts about some of the details, but certainly further cause for concern and thought.\r\n\r\nI discovered that the Charleston Gazette has a series devoted to the developments in the WV coal industry, <a href=\"http://www.wvgazette.com/News/MiningtheMountains\" target=\"_blank\">Mining the Mountains</a>.\r\n\r\nThen I found <a href=\"http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/archives/vast-stretches-of-impoverished-appalachia-look-like-they-have-been-through-a-war\" target=\"_blank\">this article.</a> The site looks like something from the 90s, but it looks at the serious economic and social crises in WV and it digests some more reputable sources on the depth of the situation. The culture of widespread joblessness, drug abuse, and welfare fraud it reports is repulsive and begs for reprieve.\r\n\r\nThe article primarily blames NAFTA and its ilk, warning about the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, which, depending on who you listen to, will expand free trade or enslave us all. <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/search/result?q=The+Bipartisan+Congressional+Trade+Priorities+Act+of+2014&amp;search_bills=1&amp;search_people=1&amp;search_committees=1&amp;search_issues=1&amp;search_congress[113]=113\" target=\"_blank\">The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014</a> is reportedly the name of the bill to codify this partnership, which critics say will severely limit individual and U.S. sovereignty. I tried to read it, but even thought it\'s only(?) 103 pages, it\'s pretty cryptic. I found <a href=\"http://www.globalresearch.ca/bipartisan-new-world-order-fast-tracking-the-trans-pacific-partnership-tpp/5365497\" target=\"_blank\">this digest</a>, which is pretty damning if accurate, but provides the silver lining that it seems to be stalled via backlash.

Congress and the states also have provisions to override unpopular decisions.

Both have their place, but it\'s not the same thing. Similar considerations arise when looking at various levels of sovereignty.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1plPyJdXKIY', 'Regulations', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '794-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-01-22 21:02:40', '2014-01-23 02:02:40', '', 794, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2014/01/22/794-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

As the linked article points out, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is not funded by congress and hence very little accountability to them. So-called \"Systemically Important\" banks is essentially codifying \"Too Big to Fail\" -- exactly the wrong message to send to banks that were bailed out for previous failures. Nearly 14,000 pages of regulation have been cranked out to implement the law. Note here that <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/hr4173-111/show\" target=\"_blank\">the bill itself</a> was approximately 2,253 pages, but couldn\'t contain a fourth of the myriad actual regulations it has spawned. This Forbes\'  quote represents a what seems to be a consensus:\r\n<blockquote>This sounds all rather confused. But that may just be the point of Dodd-Frank: to keep everything churned up so that no one is sure at any given point what the rules really are. That way financial institutions (very broadly defined in D-F as banks, insurers, and anything else that might conceivably qualify) have to constantly ask for help and guidance from busy and powerful financial regulatory bureaucrats in figuring out what they may or may not do.</blockquote>\r\nAnd yet they didn\'t even address Glass-Steagall, whose repeal many implicate in the crash.\r\n\r\nThis <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/272199/end-regulatory-overreach-jim-lacey\" target=\"_blank\">2011 National Review Article</a> gives perspective perspective on the pace of new regulations in general :\r\n<blockquote>How busy have these thousands of regulators been? The numbers tell the story. The first <em>Federal Register</em> was issued in 1936. It contained eleven pages! For the first 147 years of the nation’s existence under the Constitution we somehow managed to get by with only eleven pages of regulations. During that time we went from an insignificant state to the most powerful and economically vibrant nation on the globe. By 2008 the <em>Federal Register</em> contained 31,879 documents and 79,435 pages, while the <em>Code of Federal Regulations</em> comprised 163,333 pages in 226 individual books. Rules have been accumulating at a rate of nine pages a day since 1936. ... The <em>Federal Register</em> has grown 20 percent in just the last two years, and there are another 4,225 rules already written and winding their way through the system.</blockquote>\r\nHow can anyone keep up with all these rules?

More on that later.\r\n\r\nI was also a liberal throughout this time. In addition to heavy-handed government to stop environmental degradation, I also wanted single-payer health care, and government redistribution of wealth. Without irony, I also considered myself something of an anarchist while advocating these positions, and probably would have participated in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_bloc\" target=\"_blank\">Black Bloc</a> activism had the opportunity presented itself (similarly, I was sympathetic to Earth First! style <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-terrorism\" target=\"_blank\">environmental terrorism</a>).\r\n\r\nAround 2009, through a <a href=\"http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2010/05/16/PersonalPoliticalHistory/\" target=\"_blank\">complex series of reconsiderations</a>, I developed a more conservative worldview. This involved transitions from revolutionary to a return to first principals and, importantly, from looking to government for answers to advocacy of limited government.\r\n\r\nWhile my concern for the environment was unabated, my previous thoughts on policy implementation were no longer acceptable, so most of my advocacy was on the personal level: composting, recycling, rain barrel, prudent consumerism, riding my bike to work, organic and local food, etc.\r\n\r\n<!--more-->\r\n\r\nCompounding my change of ideas about heavy handed government initiatives, I developed a skepticism toward much of the current environmental movement. For example, if you\'ve never heard of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21\" target=\"_blank\">Agenda 21</a>, it\'s a bona fide UN action plan for sustainable development, which many consider (perhaps <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLR6ACPc2Fw\" target=\"_blank\">conspiratorially</a>) to be quite sinister:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3qW2XJZdSA\r\n\r\nRegardless of the validity of that, it\'s clear that, hypothetically, if power hungry people want to control the masses, fear of environmental threats are a good way to do that (see <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/State-Fear-Michael-Crichton/dp/0061782661\" target=\"_blank\">State of Fear</a> by <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/185495-1\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Crichten</a>.) And that gives me pause when considering the dishonest alarmism found in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">An Inconvenient Truth</span> and elsewhere. Also troubling is the tendency to call skeptics of anthropogenic global warming, \"deniers, \" as <a href=\"https://my.barackobama.com/page/s/combat-climate-deniers-now\" target=\"_blank\">President Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/21/al-gore-explains-why-hes-optimistic-about-stopping-global-warming/\" target=\"_blank\">Al Gore</a> have done, and is all over social media. Specifically:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>No one wins arguments by calling their opponent the equivalent of an idiot, which calls into question whether they are interested in conversation or just division.</li>\r\n	<li>Even assuming that there is nothing to the claims of scientific malfeasance by the IPCC and others, the claim of near certainty of our effect on the climate is bold. It just is. We\'ve seen the climate bounce back and forth between extremes in pre-history without our influence, we can\'t accurately predict the weather a month in advance, but the idea that current climate changes may not be anthropogenic is completely unreasonable?</li>\r\n	<li>Even if <a href=\"http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/01/the_myth_of_the_global_cooling_consensus.html\" target=\"_blank\">there wasn\'t scientific consensus on global cooling</a> in the 1970\'s, the fact that it got high profile coverage understandably increases public distrust.</li>\r\n	<li>Personal experience can also add to reasonable misgivings. In Indiana, we\'re having the coldest winter in years, <a href=\"http://newsbusters.org/blogs/pj-gladnick/2013/12/28/msm-glosses-over-irony-global-warming-scientists-trapped-antarctic-ice\" target=\"_blank\">climate scientists got their boat stuck in the Antarctic</a>, but the earth is warming? And I know how the warming is supposed to cause erratic weather and that a polar vortex (and/or <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25771510\" target=\"_blank\">the Sun falling asleep</a>) apparently caused our cold winter, but how can you be surprised when the average non-scientist is dubious?</li>\r\n	<li>Given this context, using AGW as a litmus test is imprudent in and of itself. Despite any anecdotal evidence, I believe the earth is likely warming and can even entertain that human activity may be contributing to that, but I understand those who are more skeptical and believe they may be more receptive to a concept such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_stewardship\" target=\"_blank\">environmental stewardship</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>The litmus test and crisis aspects of the debate seem to preclude any real discussion of policy. For example, before going all-in on wind energy, should we consider the implications of <a href=\"http://ijec.org/2013/07/24/tilting-at-windmills-a-closer-look-at-indianas-expanding-wind-power-industry/\" target=\"_blank\">displacing farmland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/wind-farms-under-fire-for-bird-kills/2011/08/25/gIQAP0bVlJ_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">killing birds</a>? Do those who derisively call AGW skeptics \"deniers\" have a \"consensus\" on ethanol or nuclear energy?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSo where was I? Oh yeah, concerned for the environment, but not necessarily trusting its spokespeople and pretty much just going with the-personal-is-political.\r\n\r\nI then (<a href=\"http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2010/06/22/MoreonGusherofLies/\" target=\"_blank\">2010</a>) discovered <a href=\"http://www.robertbryce.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Bryce</a>, who brought attention to the amazing progress we\'ve made in efficiencies and the importance of energy density.  He doesn\'t deny the (literal) limits of fossil fuels, but gives them credit for lifting (and keeping) populations out of poverty.

For example, if you\'ve never heard of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agenda_21\" target=\"_blank\">Agenda 21</a>, it\'s a bona fide UN action plan for sustainable development, which many consider (perhaps <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLR6ACPc2Fw\" target=\"_blank\">conspiratorially</a>) to be quite sinister:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3qW2XJZdSA\r\n\r\nRegardless of the validity of that, it\'s clear that, hypothetically, if power hungry people want to control the masses, fear of environmental threats are a good way to do that (see <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/State-Fear-Michael-Crichton/dp/0061782661\" target=\"_blank\">State of Fear</a> by <a href=\"http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/185495-1\" target=\"_blank\">Michael Crichten</a>.) And that gives me pause when considering the dishonest alarmism found in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">An Inconvenient Truth</span> and elsewhere. Also troubling is the tendency to call skeptics of anthropogenic global warming, \"deniers, \" as <a href=\"https://my.barackobama.com/page/s/combat-climate-deniers-now\" target=\"_blank\">President Obama</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/21/al-gore-explains-why-hes-optimistic-about-stopping-global-warming/\" target=\"_blank\">Al Gore</a> have done, and is all over social media. Specifically:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>No one wins arguments by calling their opponent the equivalent of an idiot, which calls into question whether they are interested in conversation or just division.</li>\r\n	<li>Even assuming that there is nothing to the claims of scientific malfeasance by the IPCC and others, the claim of near certainty of our effect on the climate is bold. It just is. We\'ve seen the climate bounce back and forth between extremes in pre-history without our influence, we can\'t accurately predict the weather a month in advance, but the idea that current climate changes may not be anthropogenic is completely unreasonable?</li>\r\n	<li>Even if <a href=\"http://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2014/01/the_myth_of_the_global_cooling_consensus.html\" target=\"_blank\">there wasn\'t scientific consensus on global cooling</a> in the 1970\'s, the fact that it got high profile coverage understandably increases public distrust.</li>\r\n	<li>Personal experience can also add to reasonable misgivings. In Indiana, we\'re having the coldest winter in years, <a href=\"http://newsbusters.org/blogs/pj-gladnick/2013/12/28/msm-glosses-over-irony-global-warming-scientists-trapped-antarctic-ice\" target=\"_blank\">climate scientists got their boat stuck in the Antarctic</a>, but the earth is warming? And I know how the warming is supposed to cause erratic weather and that a polar vortex (and/or <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25771510\" target=\"_blank\">the Sun falling asleep</a>) apparently caused our cold winter, but how can you be surprised when the average non-scientist is dubious?</li>\r\n	<li>Given this context, using AGW as a litmus test is imprudent in and of itself. Despite any anecdotal evidence, I believe the earth is likely warming and can even entertain that human activity may be contributing to that, but I understand those who are more skeptical and believe they may be more receptive to a concept such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_stewardship\" target=\"_blank\">environmental stewardship</a>.</li>\r\n	<li>The litmus test and crisis aspects of the debate seem to preclude any real discussion of policy. For example, before going all-in on wind energy, should we consider the implications of <a href=\"http://ijec.org/2013/07/24/tilting-at-windmills-a-closer-look-at-indianas-expanding-wind-power-industry/\" target=\"_blank\">displacing farmland</a> and <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/wind-farms-under-fire-for-bird-kills/2011/08/25/gIQAP0bVlJ_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">killing birds</a>? Do those who derisively call AGW skeptics \"deniers\" have a \"consensus\" on ethanol or nuclear energy?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nSo where was I? Oh yeah, concerned for the environment, but not necessarily trusting its spokespeople and pretty much just going with the-personal-is-political.\r\n\r\nI then (<a href=\"http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2010/06/22/MoreonGusherofLies/\" target=\"_blank\">2010</a>) discovered <a href=\"http://www.robertbryce.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robert Bryce</a>, who brought attention to the amazing progress we\'ve made in efficiencies and the importance of energy density.  He doesn\'t deny the (literal) limits of fossil fuels, but gives them credit for lifting (and keeping) populations out of poverty. He considers traditional fossil fuels a bridge to N2N (natural gas to nuclear).\r\n\r\nSo I was pretty copacetic with my personal and policy environmental policy until <a href=\"http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2014/01/21/west-virginia-chemical-spill/\" target=\"_blank\">the West Viginia spill</a>. It begs for greater oversight and a more complex response than, \"I\'m annoyed by your mindless devotion to environmental fear-mongering.\"\r\n\r\nIt\'s getting late, so I\'ll postpone my thoughts on solutions to another post.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;', 'Conservative Environmentalism', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '816-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-01-26 20:21:04', '2014-01-27 01:21:04', '', 816, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2014/01/26/816-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

The fact that she is a \"joint history of science and studies of women, gender and sexuality concentrator\" (concentrator is apparently what majors are called now) lends some credence to her seriousness.\r\n\r\nYou really need to read the whole thing (and peruse the comments), but I think the crux is this quote:\r\n<blockquote>If our university community opposes racism, sexism, and heterosexism, why should we put up with research that counters our goals simply in the name of “academic freedom”?</blockquote>\r\nIf you don\'t immediately see the problem with the above quote, it\'s that not \"put[ting] up with research that counters [y]our goals\" is not a valid reason to not put up (aka, not ban) research projects. Good reasons to ban research projects would be poor methodology, inhumane methods, fudged results, etc.\r\n\r\nMs. Korn begins by recounting a Harvard Professor in the early 70\'s who \"claimed that intelligence is almost entirely hereditary and varies by race.\"\r\n<blockquote>Students for a Democratic Society <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1971/9/28/sds-protests-at-herrnstein-soc-sci/\">protested</a> his introductory psychology class with a bullhorn and <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1971/9/28/sds-protests-at-herrnstein-soc-sci/\">leaflets</a>. They tied up Herrnstein’s <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1971/10/6/sds-meeting-discusses-anti-herrnstein-tactics-pharvard-radcliffe/\">lectures</a> with pointed questions about scientific racism. SDS even <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1973/4/14/sds-goes-after-herrnstein-pthe-commission/\">called</a> for Harvard to fire Herrnstein, along with another of his colleagues, sociologist Christopher Jencks. ...\r\n\r\nThis, Herrnstein seems not to have understood, was precisely the goal of the SDS activists—they wanted to make the “certain kinds of views” they deemed racist and classist unwelcome on Harvard’s campus.</blockquote>\r\nIf you\'re not familiar, the SDS, whose most radical faction became the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village_townhouse_explosion\" target=\"_blank\">Weather Underground,</a> was not a moderate group as evidenced above. They didn\'t debate opposition, they did their best to shut it down.\r\n\r\nThe author then comes to this conclusion about the important question to ask:\r\n<blockquote> Did SDS activists at Harvard infringe on Herrnstein’s academic freedom? The answer might be that yes, they did—but that’s not the most important question to ask. Student and faculty obsession with the doctrine of “academic freedom” often seems to bump against something I think much more important: academic justice.</blockquote>\r\nAnother paragraph and then:\r\n<blockquote>Instead, I would like to propose a more rigorous standard: one of “academic justice.” When an academic community observes research promoting or justifying oppression, it should ensure that this research does not continue.</blockquote>\r\nIt goes on, but to get back to my point, what is the meaning of:\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>SDS</strong>: They wanted to make the “certain kinds of views” <strong>they deemed</strong> racist and classist unwelcome</li>\r\n	<li>Define <strong>oppression</strong>: When an academic community observes research promoting or justifying oppression, <strong>it should ensure that this research does not continue</strong>.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n?\r\n\r\nLong story short, I think Ms. Korn is nuts, but I appreciate her opening such a frank dialogue. And I\'ll quote a commenter whose username is \"libtard\": \"<strong>The proper way to combat offensive research is to disprove it</strong>\"', 'Academic Justice, Anyone?', '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '885-revision-v1', '', '', '2014-02-23 21:06:33', '2014-02-24 02:06:33', '', 885, 'http://ttmsoia.andyhill.us/2014/02/23/885-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Living a life that is out of harmony with God is painful, and to die and be confronted so decisively with the error of your ways — to be made to see that you made a wreck of your life by separating yourself from God, and to have to learn to shatter your pride by reforming yourself in his divine presence — is, one imagines, excruciating. But it is intrinsically painful, not externally imposed by torturers in some fire-and-brimstone-filled dungeon.</blockquote>\r\nI certainly agree that it is extremely un-Christian to relish envisioning your enemies or others in eternal torment, which is why I\'ve always been gripped by the film <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob%27s_Ladder_%28film%29\" target=\"_blank\">Jacob\'s Ladder</a>, which (spoiler alert) tells the story of a dead person working through his demons before ascending to heaven. So Hitler may be in heaven now, but he had a rough time getting there and has learned the error of his ways. This type of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Universalism\" target=\"_blank\">universalism</a> is tempting, and may be accurate, but portions of scripture seem to indicate otherwise. For example:\r\n<blockquote>\"And if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it from you; it is better for you to enter life crippled or lame, than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the eternal fire,\" (<a class=\"lbsBibleRef\" href=\"http://biblia.com/bible/nasb95/Matt.%2018.8\" target=\"_blank\" data-purpose=\"bible-reference\" data-version=\"nasb95\" data-reference=\"Matt. 18.8\">Matt. 18:8</a>).<a class=\"see-footnote\" id=\"footnoteref1_2je57rs\" title=\"All scripture quotes are from the NASB.\" href=\"http://carm.org/hell-eternal#footnote1_2je57rs\">1</a></blockquote>\r\nI\'ve tried to get around this by defining eternity as a state of mind, commonly known as impatience, which may be correct, but assuming there is unequivocal eternal damnation, how would a Christian view that? In <a href=\"http://usminc.org/images/MereChristianitybyCSLewis.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Mere Christianity (PDF)</a>, C.S. Lewis tries to address the issue (page 40 in the PDF):\r\n<blockquote>Again, Christianity asserts that every individual human being is going to live for ever, and this must be either true or false. Now there are a good many things which would not be worth bothering about if I were going to live only seventy years, but which I had better bother about very seriously if I am going to live for ever. Perhaps my bad temper or my jealousy are gradually getting worse —so gradually that the increase in seventy years will not be very noticeable. But it might be absolute hell in a million years: in fact, if Christianity is true, Hell is the precisely correct technical term for what it would be. And immortality makes this other difference, which, by the by, has a connection with the\r\ndifference between totalitarianism and democracy.</blockquote>\r\nHe also addressed it in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Divorce\" target=\"_blank\">The Great Divorce (wikipedia)</a>:\r\n<blockquote>The narrator inexplicably finds himself in a grim and joyless city, the \"grey town\", which is either <a title=\"Hell\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell\">hell</a> or <a title=\"Purgatory\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purgatory\">purgatory</a> depending on how long one stays there. He eventually finds a bus for those who desire an excursion to some other place (and which eventually turns out to be the foothills of <a title=\"Heaven\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven\">heaven</a>). He enters the bus and converses with his fellow passengers as they travel. When the bus reaches its destination, the passengers on the bus — including the narrator — are gradually revealed to be <a class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Ghosts\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts\">ghosts</a>. Although the country is the most beautiful they have ever seen, every feature of the landscape (including streams of water and blades of grass) is unyieldingly solid compared to themselves: it causes them immense pain to walk on the grass, and even a single leaf is far too heavy for any to lift.</blockquote>\r\nBut my favorite quote (page 48 of the PDF) is:\r\n<blockquote>And that leads on to my second point. People often think of Christian morality as a kind of bargain in which God says, \"If you keep a lot of rules I\'ll reward you, and if you don\'t I\'ll do the other thing.\" I do not think that is the best way of looking at it. I would much rather say that every time you make a choice you are turning the central part of you, the part of you that chooses, into something a little different from what it was before. And taking your life as a whole, with all your innumerable choices, all your life long you are slowly turning this central thing either into a heavenly creature or into a hellish creature: either into a creature that is in harmony with God, and with other creatures, and with itself, or else into one that is in a state of war and hatred with God, and with its fellow-creatures, and with itself.</blockquote>\r\nIs there eternal damnation? I think there is to those who choose it. Is there some sort of heaven/hell/purgatory/reincarnation karma beyond this mortal coil?

And then, to mention the subject at all is to be greeted with howls of anger. It is not that people think this too high and difficult a virtue: it is that they think it hateful and contemptible. \"That sort of talk makes them sick,\" they say. And half of you already want to ask me, \"I wonder how you\'d feel about forgiving the Gestapo if you were a Pole or a Jew?\"\r\n\r\nSo do I. I wonder very much. Just as when Christianity tells me that I must not deny my religion even to save myself from death by torture, I wonder very much what I should do when it came to the point. I am not trying to tell you in this book what I could do—I can do precious little—I am telling you what Christianity is. I did not invent it. And there, right in the middle of it, I find \"Forgive us our sins as we forgive those that sin against us.\" There is no slightest suggestion that we are offered forgiveness on any other terms. It is made perfectly dear that if we do not forgive we shall not be forgiven. There are no two ways about it. What are we to do?\r\n\r\nIt is going to be hard enough, anyway, but I think there are two things we can do to make it easier. When you start mathematics you do not begin with the calculus; you begin with simple addition. In the same way, if we really want (but all depends on really wanting) to learn how to forgive, perhaps we had better start with something easier than the Gestapo. One might start with forgiving one\'s husband or wife, or parents or children, or the nearest N.C.O., for something they have done or said in the last week. That will probably keep us busy for the moment. And secondly, we might try to understand exactly what loving your neighbour as yourself means. I have to love him as I love myself. Well, how exactly do I love myself?\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe real test is this. Suppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper. Then suppose that something turns up suggesting that the story might not be quite true, or not quite so bad as it was made out. Is one\'s first feeling, \"Thank God, even they aren\'t quite so bad as that,\" or is it a feeling of disappointment, and even a determination to cling to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemies as bad as possible? If it is the second then it is, I am afraid, the first step in a process which, if followed to the end, will make us into devils. You see, one is beginning to wish that black was a little blacker.\r\n\r\nIf we give that wish its head, later on we shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white itself as black. Finally, we shall insist on seeing everything—God and our friends and ourselves included—as bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed for ever in a universe of pure hatred.\r\n\r\nNow a step further. Does loving your enemy mean not punishing him? No, for loving myself does not mean that I ought not to subject myself to punishment—even to death. If one had committed a murder, the right Christian thing to do would be to give yourself up to the police and be hanged. It is, therefore, in my opinion, perfectly right for a Christian judge to sentence a man to death or a Christian soldier to kill an enemy. I always have thought so, ever since I became a Christian, and long before the war, and I still think so now that we are at peace.</blockquote>\r\nFood for thought, no?', 'C.S.

And then, to mention the subject at all is to be greeted with howls of anger. It is not that people think this too high and difficult a virtue: it is that they think it hateful and contemptible. \"That sort of talk makes them sick,\" they say. And half of you already want to ask me, \"I wonder how you\'d feel about forgiving the Gestapo if you were a Pole or a Jew?\"\r\n\r\nSo do I. I wonder very much. Just as when Christianity tells me that I must not deny my religion even to save myself from death by torture, I wonder very much what I should do when it came to the point. I am not trying to tell you in this book what I could do—I can do precious little—I am telling you what Christianity is. I did not invent it. And there, right in the middle of it, I find \"Forgive us our sins as we forgive those that sin against us.\" There is no slightest suggestion that we are offered forgiveness on any other terms. It is made perfectly dear that if we do not forgive we shall not be forgiven. There are no two ways about it. What are we to do?\r\n\r\nIt is going to be hard enough, anyway, but I think there are two things we can do to make it easier. When you start mathematics you do not begin with the calculus; you begin with simple addition. In the same way, if we really want (but all depends on really wanting) to learn how to forgive, perhaps we had better start with something easier than the Gestapo. One might start with forgiving one\'s husband or wife, or parents or children, or the nearest N.C.O., for something they have done or said in the last week. That will probably keep us busy for the moment. And secondly, we might try to understand exactly what loving your neighbour as yourself means. I have to love him as I love myself. Well, how exactly do I love myself?\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThe real test is this. Suppose one reads a story of filthy atrocities in the paper. Then suppose that something turns up suggesting that the story might not be quite true, or not quite so bad as it was made out. Is one\'s first feeling, \"Thank God, even they aren\'t quite so bad as that,\" or is it a feeling of disappointment, and even a determination to cling to the first story for the sheer pleasure of thinking your enemies as bad as possible? If it is the second then it is, I am afraid, the first step in a process which, if followed to the end, will make us into devils. You see, one is beginning to wish that black was a little blacker.\r\n\r\nIf we give that wish its head, later on we shall wish to see grey as black, and then to see white itself as black. Finally, we shall insist on seeing everything—God and our friends and ourselves included—as bad, and not be able to stop doing it: we shall be fixed for ever in a universe of pure hatred.\r\n\r\nNow a step further. Does loving your enemy mean not punishing him? No, for loving myself does not mean that I ought not to subject myself to punishment—even to death. If one had committed a murder, the right Christian thing to do would be to give yourself up to the police and be hanged. It is, therefore, in my opinion, perfectly right for a Christian judge to sentence a man to death or a Christian soldier to kill an enemy.
